# Mock Project

A retail store wants to boost sales by 5% and enhance customer loyalty by identifying the causes of decline and setting clear targets. Using Python and the provided data, identify key factors contributing to the decline and create tailored solutions. Develop a presentation with your findings, recommendations, and actionable steps to improve sales and customer loyalty.

### Problem Understanding:

A retail store with an OMNI presence is experiencing a gradual sales decline over the past year. Our goal is to identify the reasons for this decline and provide insights on increasing sales by 5%, along with recommendations to boost customer loyalty.

Analysis of the data reveals:
- Sales are highest in the West, gradually decreasing to the South, and sharply declining from the Midwest to the Northeast.
- Online and on-site sales are strong, while distribution and wholesale lag behind.
- Medline has the highest order quantity (892), followed by Elorac Corp and Othaâ€™s Corp, all with orders above 500, indicating potential for increasing loyal customers.

We will present recommendations based on these findings to address specific challenges and improve sales and customer loyalty.
